# First project made while working at Experis. 

The goal of the project was to create a computer store application using vanilla JavaScrip, HTML and vanilla CSS.

The main features of the application are:

- Interactive UI that allows the user to add and subtract money to a bank balance

- Possibility to get a bank loan to add money to your bank balance

- Possibility to view different products and buy the product with your bank balance

- Retrieve data from a web API about various products, which is then dynamically displayed to the user
